# hello-world

Hi everone!

Hardik here, I'm .NET Developer.

Building web application using ASP.NET and experimenting on Windows applications in UWP (Universal Windows Platform) and WPF.

The one thing that I would say that defines me is I love to learn.
I get excited about new things. I don’t ‘know it all’ but I ‘learn it all’.
